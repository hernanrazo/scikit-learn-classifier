#Scikit-learn-classifier

A classifier that uses the scikit-learn library to predict whether the given animal measurements belong to a polar bear or gray wolf. The given measurements are height (m), length (m), and weight (kg). 

This specific example uses the decision tree, support vector classification, perceptron, and k nearest neighbor classification algorithms. Each classifier takes two input arrays, the measurements and the labels. The measurements are the dimensions of either a polar bear or a gray wolf. The labels are either ‘polar bear’ or ‘gray wolf’ depending on which of the two the previous measurements belong to.  The program then makes a new prediction for each classifier based on new data.
